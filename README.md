## Introduction
Directie is a indoor navigation mobile app that helps to guide visually handicapped people through the use of the phone's in-built bluetooth, compass and text-to-speech system. To guide the user from one point to another, Estimote Proximity Beacons, a beacon that emits bluetooth signals, are placed between each point. The bluetooth signal strength from the phone to the beacon can tells us the distance of the user, while the compass can tells us the direction of the user.

This application was developed as part of our Final Year Project in Singapore Polytechnic in 2019. Though the project was successful, there were some suggestions that can be made to improve the application such as Triangulation and support for latest devices (our build target was below Android 9 and iOS 12). There was also a continuation of our project by the next batch of students as shown here: https://www.sp.edu.sg/docs/default-source/publications/spirit/spirit_290419.pdf

## Special Thanks
We would like to thank our two lecturers, Lim Kim Hoe, Lin Zhao for assisting us in this project and also Government Technology Agency of Singapore (GovTech) for allowing us to test our application on the actual target users!
